COMPILE EXECUTABLES FOR THE GP2X
--------------------------------

make -f makefile.gp2x
make -f makefile.gp2x TARGET=neomame
make -f makefile.gp2x mame.gpe

COMPILE EXECUTABLES FOR THE WIZ
-------------------------------

make -f makefile.wiz
make -f makefile.wiz TARGET=neomame
make -f makefile.wiz mame.gpe

To be able to compile MAME4ALL for the WIZ, two files of the DevKitGP2X distribution have to be modified manually:

devkitGP2X\sysroot\usr\lib\libm.so:
/* GNU ld script
   Use the shared library, but some functions are only in
   the static library, so try that secondarily.  */
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-littlearm)
GROUP ( /lib/libm.so.6 )

devkitGP2X\sysroot\usr\lib\libpthread.so:
/* GNU ld script
   Use the shared library, but some functions are only in
   the static library, so try that secondarily.  */
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-littlearm)
GROUP ( /lib/libpthread.so.0 )

COMPILE EXECUTABLES FOR THE CAANOO
----------------------------------

Use Sourcery G++ Lite 2006q1-6 (http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release293)

make -f makefile.caanoo
make -f makefile.caanoo TARGET=neomame
make -f makefile.caanoo mame.gpe
